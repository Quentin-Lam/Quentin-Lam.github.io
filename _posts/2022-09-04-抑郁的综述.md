## 主要结果：

- 对比emotional stroop task和dot probe task的效应量发现，dot probe task更能反映出抑郁患者对消极情绪刺激的注意偏向（d = 0.52, P < .001, 95% CI = .30, .74）对比emotional stroop的(d = 0.17, P = .06, 95% CI = .07, .34)。

- Dot probe studies were categorized as using either verbal (emotional words, n = 5) or nonverbal (emotional faces or pictures, n = 9) stimuli (all Stroop studies used verbal stimuli). `No difference` was found in the magnitude of effect size `for verbal and nonverbal stimuli` (t(12) = .89, P = .26). Likewise, comparison of dot probe studies using greater than 1,000 msec stimuli presentations (n = 9, d = 0.59) relative to those that used 500 msec presentations (n = 7, d = 0.54) revealed no significant differences (t(12) = .21, P = .85).

  刺激类型，呈现时长对结果的发现均没有显著影响

- There were no significant group differences in attentional bias toward `physically threatening stimuli` (d = 0.02, n = 3,
  P = .89, CI = .22, .23); however, there was a trend toward greater attentional bias among depressed participants toward `socially threatening stimuli`( ≈ 愤怒面孔) (d = 0.15, n = 8, P = .10, CI = .03, .33).

  抑郁患者可能对愤怒面孔有注意偏向

- In dot probe studies, the effect tended to be larger among patients (n = 6, d = 0.70) relative to nonpatients (n = 8, d = 0.47); however, again this effect was not significant (P = .38).

  抑郁患者相比于正常人对dot probe范式的注意偏向效应量会更大

本文为反驳Williams的theory of cognitive biases提供了有力证据，证明抑郁患者中也存在焦虑患者中存在的attentional bias，并非只有biased memory提供了证据，并且明确表示dot probe task是比emotional stroop task更好的测量注意偏差的范式，理由是dot probe task的效应量更大且更稳定。

Overall, the results of our analysis demonstrate that depressed groups exhibit significantly
greater attentional bias toward negative information relative to nondepressed groups, but the absolute values of this bias (i.e., whether it they are greater than 0) cannot be inferred. And our results verify that attentional bias is present in depression when measured by the dot probe task, a finding that begins to resolve the controversy surrounding attention bias in depression.

Notably, the absence of a significant difference in biased attention `between clinical and nonclinical levels of symptoms` was also observed in a meta-analysis of biased attention in anxiety.[14] As such, one implication of our findings is that biased attention to negative stimuli is a state characteristic of negative affect (depressed or anxious mood) rather than a marker of clinical depression.

- 开篇：Cognitive models of depression assert that biases in the processing of emotional information contribute to the onset and maintenance of the disorder. According to these models, mood-congruent information processing biases influence memory, interpretation, and attention in individuals with emotional disorders.

  人对情绪信息的注意偏差可能是由抑郁障碍引起的。

- The lack of consistent evidence for biased attentional processing in depression has led some researchers to hypothesize that depression is characterized by memory but not attention bias, whereas anxiety is characterized by attentional but not memory bias.

  “抑郁可能不是由注意偏差影响的”这件事使得人们提出假说：depression serves to focus emotional processing on past failures so that unsuccessful endeavors can be avoided, whereas anxiety helps to protect an individual from current or future threat.

### 关于实验刺激：

- anxiety患者的注意偏向很明显，然而抑郁患者的不明显，对于如何发现抑郁患者不明显的、subliminal的注意偏向，前人给出了以下经验：刺激至少要呈现1000毫秒（我们的实验有2000毫秒）

  There is little evidence for subliminal attentional bias in depression, and that an attentional bias in depression is typically only found when the material is self-referent and is presented for long (≥1,000 ms) durations.

  18. Mogg K, Bradley BP, Williams R. Attentional bias in anxiety and depression: the role of awareness. Brit J Clin Psychol 1995;34:17–36.

  There is evidence for biased attention in depression, but only when the information is mood-congruent and presented for a duration of 1,000 msec or more.

- `Threatening stimuli` that are often associated with attention bias in anxiety have generally `not been associated with biased attention in depression`.

- Also, researchers have hypothesized that using `emotional faces` instead of words may be `a better indicator` of attentional bias, because faces are both more salient and more strongly related to social interaction than words.

### 关于实验范式:

主要有`emotional stroop task`和`dot probe task`（眼动）

The emotional Stroop task is a version of the Stroop task that requires participants to report the color of an emotionally valenced word. The emotional Stroop effect is observed when participants with emotional disorders are `delayed` in their color-naming response `to emotional stimuli` relative to neutral stimuli.

#### 对emotional stroop的批判

The emotional Stroop task has been criticized
by researchers who argue that it provides an ambiguous measure of attention, that the observed effect may reflect a type of response bias, or that the response is simply the effect of `state-dependent mood congruence`.

批判情绪stroop范式只测量了任务依赖的情绪一致性的判断，而非对情绪本身的注意

（核磁的范式是测量的是对情绪面孔和情绪文字的stroop效应，理论上应当是面孔和文字情绪不一致的时候反应时更长，并且正确率更低？）

An additional limitation is that the emotional Stroop task is that it allows only one stimulus (one word) to be presented at a time.

9. MacLeod C, Mathews A, Tata P. Attentional bias in emotional disorders. J Abnorm Psychol 1986;95:15–20.

In dot probe task, the two stimuli are presented quickly on a computer screen, and one word is replaced by a probe. Participants respond by pressing a key to correspond to the location of the probe. Attentional bias can then be derived by `subtracting the average reaction time when the probe replaces negative words from the average reaction time when the probe replaces neutral words`.

##### 计算效应量

According to Cohen’s standards, effect sizes (d) of 0.2 are considered small, 0.5 are considered medium, and 0.8 are considered large.

##### 发表偏差

In order to evaluate for publication bias, we calculated the ‘‘failsafe N’’[28,29] separately for emotional Stroop studies and dot probe studies. This method is hypothesized to generate the number of null results needed to render the effect size nonsignificant, and is
calculated by `multiplying the number of studies being analyzed by 5 and then adding 10 to this number`.[29] Additionally, we constructed a funnel plot based on mean effect size, and evaluated year of publication as a standard moderator to further evaluate the possibility of publication bias. These analyses were completed using the Comprehensive Meta-Analysis software program.[30]
